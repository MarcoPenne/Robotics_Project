## Code
Simulation_1dof_new.m and Simulation_3dof_new.m should be run to simulate the execution of a trajectory in V-REP. They also save Y and u tensors.

PBRP_1dof_tree.m and PBRP_3dof_tree.m execute the PBRP tree algorithm returning the dynamic parameters.

dynamic_model_3R.m computes the dynamic model of the 3R robot.
