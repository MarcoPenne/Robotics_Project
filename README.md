# Robotics_Project

Codes are in first attempt folder.

Simulation_1dof.mlx and Simulation_3dof.mlx should be run to stimulate the execution of a trajectory.

PBRP_1dof_wo_signs.m and PBRP_3dof_wo_signs.m execute the PBRP algorithm returning the dynamic parameters.

dynamic_model_3R.m computes the dynamic model of the 3R robot.
